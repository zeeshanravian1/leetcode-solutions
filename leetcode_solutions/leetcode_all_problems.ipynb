    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of\n",
    "the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not\n",
    "use the same element twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** [0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** [1,2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** [0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $2 <= nums.length <= 10^4$\n",
    "- $-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9$\n",
    "- $-10^9 <= target <= 10^9$\n",
    "- **Only one valid answer exists.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time\n",
    "complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires finding two indices in a list such that the sum of the\n",
    "elements at these indices equals a given target. A brute force approach would\n",
    "involve checking all pairs of indices, but this would be inefficient. Instead,\n",
    "a more efficient solution can be achieved using a hash map (dictionary) to\n",
    "store and quickly look up the indices of previously seen numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "- **Initialize a Hash Map (Dictionary):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create an empty dictionary called\n",
    "seen to store numbers and their corresponding indices as you iterate through\n",
    "the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterate through the List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each number in the list, calculate its\n",
    "complement with respect to the target (i.e., target - num).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check for Complement:**\n",
    "    - If the complement is already in the dictionary, it means a pair of\n",
    "    numbers that add up to the target has been found. Return the indices of the\n",
    "    current number and its complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the complement is not found, store the current number and its index\n",
    "    in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Return Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    If no such pair is found by the end of the iteration,\n",
    "return an empty list (though the problem guarantees exactly one solution, so\n",
    "this return is more of a safeguard).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity of this approach is **𝑂(𝑛)**, where **𝑛** is the number\n",
    "    of elements in the list. This is because we iterate through the list once,\n",
    "    and each dictionary operation (insertion and lookup) is **𝑂(1)** on average\n",
    "    .\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The space complexity is **𝑂(𝑛)** because, in the worst case, we might store\n",
    "    all **𝑛** elements in the dictionary if no two elements sum up to the\n",
    "    target until the end."
